# The following function returns a list of the remainders of dividing 
# the numbers in numbers by 5:

def remainders_5(numbers):
    return [number % 5 for number in numbers]

# Use this function to determine which of the following lists do not 
# contain any numbers that are divisible by 5:

numbers_1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
numbers_2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]
numbers_3 = [0, 5, 10]
numbers_4 = []

# Note: when working with integers, a value of 0 is "falsy"; all other 
# integers are "truthy".

print(all(remainders_5(numbers_1)))     # False
print(all(remainders_5(numbers_2)))     # True
print(all(remainders_5(numbers_3)))     # False
print(all(remainders_5(numbers_4)))     # True

# `remainders_5` is similar to `remainders_3` in the previous exercise in 
# that it returns a list of integers. In this list, a value of `0` means 
# the corresponding number is divisible by `5`, while a non-zero value 
# means the number is not divisible by `5`. Since `0` is falsy and the 
# other integers are truthy, we can use all to determine whether all 
# of the numbers are not divisible by `5`.

# NOTE
# Remember to read the question CAREFULLY!!

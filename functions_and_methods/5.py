# What does the following code print?

def scream(words):

scream('Yipeee')

# Nothing, there's no `print()` function so it will not print anything.

# This program doesn't output anything. The function returns a value, 
# Yipeee!!!!, but it doesn't do anything with it. In particular, it 
# doesn't print it.

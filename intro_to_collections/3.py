# Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. 
# Identify at least 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar.

# DIFFERENCES
# Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable.
# Lists with a single element can be created normally, like `[0]`;
# But tuples with a single element needs a comma after the object, like
# `(0,)` to differentiate it from regular expressions enclosed in 
# parentheses. 

# SIMILARITIES
# They are both collection types.
# You can access their elements by using the square bracket operator.


# SOLUTION

# Differences

# Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable.
# List literals use []; tuple literals use ().

# Similarities

# Lists and tuples are both sequences. Sequences are ordered collections 
# that can use numeric indexes to access the members.
# Lists and tuples are heterogeneous; elements do not need to all be 
# the same type.
